  <div class="entry-content"><div>Quantity: unknown. I used this recipe to make a big top cupcake, but lets just guess that it would have made around 22 small top cupcakes.

Cake Ingredients
<ul>
    <li>2 c flour</li>
    <li>1 t baking soda</li>
    <li>1 t baking powder</li>
    <li>½ t salt</li>
    <li>2 c shredded coconut</li>
    <li>2/3 c coconut oil</li>
    <li>½ c pineapple juice (from canned pineapple)</li>
    <li>1 ½ c sugar</li>
    <li>1 and 3/4 c coconut milk (1 can)</li>
    <li>1/4 c soymilk</li>
    <li>1 T vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 T apple cider vinegar</li>
</ul>
Cake Directions

Melt oil in glass measuring cup in oven (or on stove using low heat if you don&#8217;t have a pyrex measuring cup). Add sugar, milks, vanilla, and pineapple juice to coconut oil and whisk to combine.

Sift together the first 4 dry ingredients in a large bowl. Add the coconut.

Add dry ingredients to wet, until incorporated. Add vinegar. Mix slightly and pour.

Bake in a 350º oven for 24 minutes.

Filling Ingredients
<ul>
    <li>1 can pineapple</li>
    <li>½ c sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 c pineapple juice (dilute with water if there&#8217;s not enough)</li>
</ul>
Filling Directions

Stir together sugar, pineapple, and half of the juice in a saucepan over low heat. 

In separate bowl, using a whisk or an immersion blender, blend the remaining juice with the cornstarch, and then add to the saucepan. 

Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until very thick. Cool.

Icing Ingredients
<ul>
    <li>½ c earth balance coconut spread</li>
    <li>½ c palm shortening</li>
    <li>1 t vanilla</li>
    <li>½ cup coconut milk (use the part from the can that is thicker)</li>
    <li>4 c powdered sugar</li>
</ul>
Icing Directions

Beat together the earth balance, palm shortening, and coconut milk until fluffy.

Add the confectioner’s sugar, sifting it in, and then beat until smooth and fluffy (~3 minutes).

Add vanilla and beat for 3 more minutes.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Please excuse any <del>misinformation</del> lies in this posting, but these cupcakes were made, eaten, and discussed approximately 387465 days ago, and that in conjunction with having a memory equivalent of a snail&#8217;s, makes my rendition of this story almost guaranteed to be slightly different than real life.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a super sweet, amazing girl named Amber. Amber was having a rough week, and therefore in need of some cheerful (but not too cheerful) cupcakes. That was how the &#8220;blueberry&#8221; cupcakes were born. I thought that blue cupcakes would be fitting since Amber had been feeling blue, and everyone (everyone = me) wants a cupcake to sympathize with them by matching their mood, right? So, what Eidelyn and I learned after presenting people with these chocolate cupcakes topped with blue vanilla icing, was that humans associate colors with flavors. And the flavor that our human friends associate with blue is blueberry. So, then we wondered if we let them think it was blueberry, would their mind control win in a battle against their taste buds, leading them to believe that the cupcakes were indeed blueberry, when they were only vanilla. Some people might think it was a mean trick to treat their friends like lab rats by performing social experiments on them, but everyone already knows that I&#8217;m mean, and Eidelyn will basically sacrifice all of her morals in the name of science. So, basically those people would be wrong. Yay science!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After accepting an invitation to vegan brunch from Shane, Jessica and I had a planning session for our next LA road trip over a raw cacao (cacao!) shake and a tuna melt that was not as tasty as the one from Red Velvet, but probably healthier. Since Jessica was too full for dessert, we took it to go. they had 2 kinds of GF vegan cupcakes, as well as 4 varieties of regular ones and this most delicious looking strawberry shortcake cupcake.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was pretty sure I had hit a high point in life a couple of years ago when Douglas&#8217; ex-co-worker made vegan samoas, and I got to have one for my very own. But I was wrong. I&#8217;m pretty sure this vegan cupcake version of a samoa wins by a long shot. I can&#8217;t wait to make them! But until then, I&#8217;ll be drooling over this picture of them.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Virginia had the most amazing idea of making cupcake (and other sweets, if you believe in those) hair accessories, and since I had just moved into my new dollhouse, we decided to make it a cupcake-themed dollhousewarming party. I know, I know, I should have thought of something more original&#8230;.if I have to go to another cupcake-themed dollhousewarming party, I will seriously rip my hair out. Well, mediocrity is just the theme of my life&#8230;if you don&#8217;t like it, don&#8217;t read about it.</p>

<p>In addition to making hair accessories, we also had the option of decorating cupcakes to match our hair creation. I&#8217;m not sure what happened to the rest of the photographs from this event. There may have been one of my first hair accessory, which was a 3D cupcake on a headband, but it was so ugly that I asked Zen to hide it forever, which ended up turning into a fun game of him laughing everytime he saw it, and me wishing I had burned it on a stake. Luckily, no photographic evidence remains of that failed attempt, and I still had plenty of time to make the smallish cupcake bow featured in this lovely photo taken by Josipa.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently, cupcakes are the new apple because Isabelle insisted on bringing cupcakes to school on the first day of 4th grade. Kylene (former 2nd grade teacher) said that this tactic was a good one, because not only are cupcakes wayyyyy better than apples (those might not have been the exact words she used), but it would ensure that Isabelle will be well-liked by all the cupcake-eating nine-year-olds. I suggested the idea of making cupcake minis for numerous reasons including 1) the children are mini and therefore their cupcakes should match, 2) making 29 full-sized cupcakes means tripling the batch, which is just ridiculous, and 3) I figured for the teacher&#8217;s first day back after summer break, she might not appreciate having a class full of children drugged on high quantities of sugar.
So, Isabelle chose chocolate cupcakes with mint icing. Over the course of 2 nights, she made all the cupcakes herself and was ultra excited to use the piping bag to ice them for her very first time.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an effort to further draw out my birthday (regularly occurring annually in May) as noted in the blogpost about <a href="http://www.ieatcupcakes.com/2011/08/18/rilakkuma-cupcakes" target="_blank">Jessica&#8217;s birthday</a>, we had my final birthday celebration (shared with Lulu&#8217;s birthday&#8230;just one of the few caveats of making your birthday last 4 months) this past weekend under the guise of hello kitty karaoke!</p>

<p>Pandora karaoke may not have the best music selection, but what they lack in musical quality, they make up for in hot chicks that work there and an ultra-cute hello-kitty-themed private karaoke room. Oh, they also search your stuff on your way in so don&#8217;t try to be too sneaky (or at least not via purse).</p>

<p>In order to prepare for this momentous occasion, I hired cupcake <del datetime="2011-09-01T04:48:14+00:00">slaves</del> elves (correction by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6095292413" target="_blank">Jocelyn</a>) to assist in the two-day process of making hello-kitty-themed cupcakes.</p>

<p>This music video is brought to you by the policy strictly adhered to by all EY employees that they refer to as the &#8220;picture or it didn&#8217;t happen&#8221; policy. In this case, the picture format requested was that of a music video, which Jessica flawlessly provided within moments of the request. I hope that all current and former EY employees request photographic evidence of all cupcake-making adventures forevermore, as it helps my blog become a more multi-dimensional archive of vegan cupcake insanity.</p>

<iframe width="460" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gKH_oeH8CTw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Now that the documentation of cupcake creation has been covered, let&#8217;s watch the funnest (yes, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=funnest" target="_blank">funnest</a> is a word) part of cupcakes - the devouration! (yes, that&#8217;s a word too&#8230;no need to look it up&#8230;put the dictionary down right now! I have a spatula and I&#8217;m not afraid to use it.)</p>

<p>Eidelyn is my most talented photographing friend, so needless to say, the following photos are all hers!
<a href="http://http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6102354944" rel="Hello Kitty cupcakes"><img src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cupcakes1-510x340.jpg" alt="Hello Kitty cupcakes" title="Hello Kitty cupcakes" width="510" height="340" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1024" /></a></p>

<p>If I had a time machine*, I would go back and draw whiskers on Jessica and Virginia because seriously??!!! How effing adorable are they???? It&#8217;s actually probably best that they didn&#8217;t have whiskers or I might have mistaken them for cupcakes (and myself for a cat) and licked their cute little faces.</p>

<p><a href="http://http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6102354198" rel="Jessica and Virginia"><img src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Jessica-Virginia-510x340.jpg" alt="Jessica and Virginia" title="Jessica and Virginia" width="510" height="340" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1025" /></a></p>

<p>Pamela and I with the peeping hello kitty and of course, cupcakes!</p>

<p><a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/?attachment_id=1035" rel="Pamela and Robin"><img src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cupcakes-Pam-me-510x510.jpg" alt="Pamela and Robin" title="Pamela and Robin" width="510" height="510" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1035" /></a></p>

<p>This is what happens when you eat too many hello kitty cupcakes. You start turning into a kitty.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6102393844" rel="Hello Kitty karaoke"><img src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/groupshot-510x340.jpg" alt="Hello Kitty karaoke" title="Hello Kitty karaoke" width="510" height="340" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1030" /></a></p>

<p>*I would also go back to that time I met that stupid mean boy in my 4th/5th grade combination class who wrote my phone number all over the entirety of Milpitas, causing what seemed like an eternity of prank calls to my house, and I&#8217;d have used better judgement in giving out my phone number. If anyone wants to hunt him down, and deliver a punishment, his name was Ed Fletcher. I will repay you in cupcakes&#8230;.the amount/flavor dependent on the severity of his lashings.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During the time Marcie worked with me, I never realized that an adult could eat so much peanut butter and jelly. She was more obsessed with these sandwiches than a child. I never understood the appeal really. I like my food savory and my sweets ultra-sweet. I&#8217;m not down with fruit in my salad or lightly sweetened desserts. So, while I was preparing for Marcie&#8217;s birthday celebration (aka. picking out bows), I was trying to figure out a way to make a peanut butter and jelly sound good to me. My conclusion was to take away the bread, add chocolate (there&#8217;s really no point in eating anything that doesn&#8217;t involve chocolate), and pump up the sweetness. Behold the Peanut Butter and Jelly chocolate cupcake! It&#8217;s basically just the <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/e-t-cupcake-recipe/">E.T. cupcake recipe</a>, but with strawberry preserves injected in the center. Jessica kindly recorded the injection process, but it was more out of disgust than awe. Regardless of her intentions, now there will be no question as to how to make these delicious cupcakes. Warning: If you are prone to motion sickness (or injection sickness), you may choose to skip this (not so) entertaining movie.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UJ9aPV9JbEE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The icing didn&#8217;t come out as pretty as I had hoped because I decided to try to use mostly peanut butter and very little shortening or earth balance. Marcie is a personal trainer, so I knew she wouldn&#8217;t want a lot of fat in her birthday cupcakes. If you follow the recipe exactly, your icing with be much prettier.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="attachment wp-att-965" href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2011/08/18/rilakkuma-cupcakes/rc/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-965" title="Rilakkuma Cupcakes" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/rc-510x500.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="500" /></a>
Jessica (like myself) is pretty good at drawing out the whole birthday thing to get as much mileage out of it as possible. She&#8217;ll never be as good as I am at this, but she can always strive for my status.*  Being the good student that she is, Jessica had a super fun adventure on her birthday week that involved a scavenger hunt each day with fun games such as this one:
<a rel="attachment wp-att-960" href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2011/08/18/rilakkuma-cupcakes/puzzle/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-960" title="scavenger-hunt" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/puzzle-408x510.png" alt="" width="408" height="510" /></a></p>

<p>And on the final day, she received a super cute rilakkuma soap dispenser for all her hard work during her birthday week.</p>

<p>Then, true to the milking-a-birthday-for-all-it&#8217;s-worth mentality, she got to have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/sets/72157627425671870/with/6048653362/" target="_blank">birthday party</a> 2 weeks after her birthday! It was a super fun and crazy party, one in which I did not want to leave, but luckily, Lulu and Randy (thank you guys!) were ready to go at a reasonable hour so I was able to wake up in the morning and drag myself out of bed to take my mommy to brunch in SF. The best part of the entire party was when Jessica made the rule that all cupcakes had to be eaten in a lady-and-the-tramp-pasta-scene style. Oh, the fun! The best ones are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6039779820/in/set-72157627425671870">here</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6048100777/in/set-72157627425671870">here</a>.</p>

<p>This post is all out of order. So, let&#8217;s get into a DeLorean and go back to the day of Jessica&#8217;s party when we were at Great America all day, and around 5 something I remembered that I was supposed to make cupcakes for her party! So, we raced home, and I baked the fastest batch of <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/e-t-cupcake-recipe/">peanut butter chocolate cupcakes</a> that I have ever baked in my life. I got home at 6:15pm and Lulu and Randy were coming at 7:30pm to pick me up. I still needed to shower and get ready for the party, make dinner for the family, eat (this is important because whenever I drink without eating dinner, bad bad things happen), and make and decorate the cupcakes. There was no way I would have gotten all of this done without my child-mom-slave labor camp I employ. Look at them hard at work!</p>

<p>Here is the final result after the attack:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>David found this because it&#8217;s bears a resemblance to some nerdy-open-source-project-thingie that he&#8217;s always getting himself into. I don&#8217;t know much about it, except that it will be people eating cupcakes, which hopefully will include some baked (and eaten) by me (and hopefully you)!  If anyone is interested in going to this with me to sample cupcakes, or just baking/decorating with me, let me know because this sounds like it could potentially be awesome (as long as it has nothing to do with camping&#8230;or the outdoors&#8230;or bugs).</p>

<p><a href="http://cupcakecamp.org/" target="_blank">CupcakeCamp</a> will be held on Sunday, October 23rd, 2011 from 2-5pm (but really? will cupcakes last that long??? I think not!)</p>
