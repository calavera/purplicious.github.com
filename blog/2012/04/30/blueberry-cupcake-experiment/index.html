<div class="entry-content"><p>Please excuse any <del>misinformation</del> lies in this posting, but these cupcakes were made, eaten, and discussed approximately 387465 days ago, and that in conjunction with having a memory equivalent of a snail&#8217;s, makes my rendition of this story almost guaranteed to be slightly different than real life.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a super sweet, amazing girl named Amber. Amber was having a rough week, and therefore in need of some cheerful (but not too cheerful) cupcakes. That was how the &#8220;blueberry&#8221; cupcakes were born. I thought that blue cupcakes would be fitting since Amber had been feeling blue, and everyone (everyone = me) wants a cupcake to sympathize with them by matching their mood, right? So, what Eidelyn and I learned after presenting people with these chocolate cupcakes topped with blue vanilla icing, was that humans associate colors with flavors. And the flavor that our human friends associate with blue is blueberry. So, then we wondered if we let them think it was blueberry, would their mind control win in a battle against their taste buds, leading them to believe that the cupcakes were indeed blueberry, when they were only vanilla. Some people might think it was a mean trick to treat their friends like lab rats by performing social experiments on them, but everyone already knows that I&#8217;m mean, and Eidelyn will basically sacrifice all of her morals in the name of science. So, basically those people would be wrong. Yay science!</p>

<p>This is what cupcakes look like when they get tucked into bed for the night.</p>

<p>This little cupcake house is care of Emily, my favoritest baker ever! My cupcakes have never been so excited to go for a ride in the car before! They really liked looking out the windows.</p>
