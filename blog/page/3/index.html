  <div class="entry-content"><p>These <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/mint-cookies-n-cream-cupcakes/">vegan mint cookies n cream cupcakes</a> are a Robin and Isabelle rendition of the cookies n cream cupcake recipe in Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World (VCTOTW).  For those of you who had the pleasure of visiting Maggie Mudd before they decided to break the hearts of vegans all over the world (well, maybe just in the San Francisco bay area), you may know why the vegan mint cookies n cream ice cream flavor would entice someone to make a cupcake version of it. It&#8217;s basically amazing. And luckily, Colby had a birthday recently, and the exquisite Katie got him the raddest World of Warcraft ice cream cake ever from Maggie Mudd (yes, they haven&#8217;t completely sold us out&#8230;they are still offering ridiculously priced vegan ice cream cakes for you die-hard fans out there)! Instead of going into the details of the cake design being a timeline of all of Colby&#8217;s current and past WOW characters, I will instead describe the deliciousness that is the mint cookies n cream ice cream that was enveloped by a brownie crust and the most delicious whipped topping icing I have ever experienced (I must get more info on this stuff from Violet asap). So, in lieu of ordering a $2749674 cake this evening, Isabelle and I decided to make <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/mint-cookies-n-cream-cupcakes/">these</a> instead.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever thought to yourself, &#8220;I have the best friends in the entire world?&#8221; Well, you would be wrong, because my friends are the best in the whole world, making yours second best. That&#8217;s how ranking works. I know this because I recently started using the rank function in excel for our coffee club at work. I have also learned that if two kinds of coffee have the same ranking (and therefore are tied), then the following ranking skips a number. So, I believe that currently the peaberry from bluebottle and the hair bender from stumptown are in a tie for position 2. That means that the next highest score is ranked 4. Mhm. I&#8217;m basically the ranking expert, so unless you are part of my friend circle, you cannot possible have better friends than the ones I have. And why are my friends so awesome, you ask? Besides the obvious reasons (including their cute factor, their ability-to-put-up-with-me factor, and their fun factor), they also happen to know how to plan the most amazing events! Last weekend is a prime example of this unprecedented skill of theirs. Last weekend, they planned the most amazing of all amazing brunches ever&#8230;.</p>

<p>Vegan Cupcake and Coffee Brunch! You might think that this is not much of a feat, considering there&#8217;s no &#8220;real&#8221; food involved, but considering I am the only vegan in the group, and that this was the first attempt at vegan baking for many of them (first attempt at any baking for one of them), this was basically the best thing ever!</p>

<p>When Amber heard about the cupcake brunch, she suggested there may be too much sweet for one brunch, so Pam and I responded to her concern with pizza cupcakes and spinach and mushroom quiche cupcakes with sun-dried tomato cream cheese icing, in an (inane) effort to have a healthy option.</p>

<p>Thanks to Eidelyn for being the talented event photographer, as usual. We started the brunch by each eating one of the cupcakes we made ourselves. Don&#8217;t ask how many more we ate after that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was a day that should have gone down in history, if only I could recall what day it was. Not important; like birthdays and anniversaries, we can just make up a day. Let&#8217;s call this one May 1st and every May 1st from now on, we can celebrate the day when I successfully made something gluten-free that I didn&#8217;t feel compelled to feed to the dog or the compost in an effort to hide my disastrous attempts. In this case, they would have had to go into the compost because they were chocolate cupcakes, which contrary to what Dexter may try to convince you of when you are in possession of anything chocolate and delicious, are not good for him. They are, however, good for me and my tummy. And not just my tummy, but also <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">my mouth. Wait, that wasn&#8217;t what I meant&#8230;is it time for dessert? What I meant was that the cupcakes are also good</span> as a pie crust.</p>

<p>So, this all started when I thought it would be a great idea to volunteer my precious cupcake-baking, kiddo-entertaining, apron-sewing time as an assistant caterer for a dinner that was included as an auction item in the spring gala. Unlike other service-oriented donations I have been duped into donating in the past, this time the auction winner didn&#8217;t forget about their purchase and actually wanted to cash it in&#8211;the gall of some people, right? So, one of my delegated jobs as assistant caterer was to make a gluten-free dessert.</p>

<p>Of course my plan was to make cupcakes, but that would be the decision of a freelance caterer, not a lowly assistant. I was given a specific menu of a chocolate espresso cheesecake because the dinner we catered had an italian theme. Well, if you had seen this cheesecake recipe they sent me, you&#8217;d have gone into cardiac arrest just from reading the list of cholesterol-filled ingredients. Veganizing the cheesecake recipe was easy-peasy, thanks to my amazing friend Melissa, who was kind enough to share her super-top-secret-she-would-take-my-first-born-if-I-ever-shared-it-with-anyone-recipe.</p>

<p>The hard part was how to make the chocolate crust gluten-free. This would likely be easy for many people who are not me, but I am not a gluten-free individual by any means. I like gluten. Sometimes I will eat an entire meal made mainly out of protein-rich glutenous morsels of deep-fried yumminess (fried seitan nuggets, I love you).  So, I decided to consult with an expert. Babycakes. If you are unfamiliar with Babycakes, you can either go to New York, or you can watch this <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2009/09/30/babycakes-should-use-this-video-to-recruit-employees/">adorable video</a> that I posted on my blog a year or so ago.</p>

<p>Luckily, Sandy, the gala auction queen bee has been so busy running the gala auction that she hasn&#8217;t needed her babycakes cookbook so she loaned it to me for an entire month! And it couldn&#8217;t have come at a more perfect time because apparently, gluten-free pie crust is as easy as mashing up gluten-free cupcakes and pressing them into the bottom of a well-oiled springform pan lined with parchment paper. Viola.</p>

<p>I got many many compliments on the dessert and since the crust only used 5 cupcakes, we still had 7 to eat! And we actually wanted to eat them, not put them in the compost or feed them to the homeless (there&#8217;s only one homeless person in Sunnyvale anyway and we don&#8217;t want her to get fat). Here&#8217;s <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/allergen-free-cupcakes/">the recipe</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>24 chocolate vegan gluten-free cupcakes (recipe from Babycakes cookbook)</p>

<p>Ingredients</p>

<ul>
    <li>1.75 c garbanzo-fava bean flour</li>
    <li>1/2 c potato starch</li>
    <li>1 c cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1/4 c arrowroot powder</li>
    <li>1.5 T Hain Featherweight brand Baking Powder*</li>
    <li>1/2 t baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 t xantham gum</li>
    <li>2 t salt</li>
    <li>1 c coconut oil, melted in the oven</li>
    <li>1.5 c agave nectar</li>
    <li>3/4 c applesauce</li>
    <li>3 T vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 c hot water</li>
</ul>


<p>*If you don&#8217;t have that brand of baking powder and you are making these for someone with a corn allergy, substitute with the following: 1 t baking soda, 2 t cream of tartar, and 2 t arrowroot</p>

<p>Directions</p>

<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, potato starch, cocoa powder, arrowroot, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt. Add the oil, agave nectar, applesauce, vanilla, and hot water directly to the dry ingredients. Stir until the batter is smooth.</p>

<p>Pour batter into each prepared cup until they are almost entirely full. Bake the cupcakes on the center rack for 22 minutes, rotating the tray 180 degrees after 15 minutes. The cupcakes will bounce back when pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center will come out clean. Remove from the oven.</p>

<p>Let the cupcakes stand for 20 minutes. Transfer them to a wire rack right side up and cool completely. Place the cupcakes in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is what she tells me in an email accompanying this picture of the cutest paper towels in the entire world. Well, this planet at least. These seriously make me want to go and clean her house. Which would be considered weird in most circles. But, even with this inordinate longing to clean her house, it doesn&#8217;t surprise me in the least that her disposable cleaning products are cuter than my non-disposable ones, because in case you don&#8217;t already know <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/soundinwater/sets/72157594237590117/">Bardot</a>, everything she owns is cute!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of the time, when I see delicious looking vegan cupcakes, it makes me want to eat them. Occasionally, I come across one or many that make me want to bathe in them. But this could very well be the first time that I have actually wanted to be a cupcake. And the amazing cupcake artist who hath done this to me is none other than <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sweetelitescupcakes/5639276094">sweet elites vegan cupcakes</a>! Check out these Piña Colada Cupcakes with the umbrellas.</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-733" href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2011/04/26/who-needs-hawaii-when-you-have-these/pina-colada-cupcake/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-733 alignnone" title="pina-colada-cupcake" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/pina-colada-cupcake-382x510.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="510" /></a></p>

<p>I had an umbrella on my drink in Hawaii, but why do we never get umbrellas at the bars in SF? It&#8217;s bullshit really. Next time I order my absolute press with lime, I&#8217;m going to say, &#8220;absolute press with lime and a purple umbrella please.&#8221; I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes. Until then, if you are not the type of person to spend a day in the kitchen making hawaiian resorts in a cupcake paper liner, you can order these direct from Fresno, CA, and have them delivered*!!!!</p>

<ul>
<li>You have to order 6 dozen to have them delivered to the bay area, so let&#8217;s pull our resources! Do I have 5 friends who want to go in on these with me?</li>
