  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why have I never thought to make <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/carrot-cupcakes-recipe/">carrot cake cupcakes</a> before? Did I forget how delicious carrot cake was? Is it the lack of chocolatey goodness in them that my aversion, forgetfulness, or avoidance stems from? I don&#8217;t think anyone really knows the answer to these questions, however, I must say that carrot cake cupcakes might just be the new chocolate cupcake for me. I made these for the first time in celebration of Eidelyn&#8217;s birthday. The craft girls all nominated me to be the delivery girl; not because I look like kiki the delivery witch (although I did after my stylist freshly dyed my hair black the weekend before), but because I work in Palo Alto, the closest to Redwood City (workplace of the birthday girl).</p>

<p>Because I have no need to make test tube babies (Who in their right mind would have children on purpose?!), I hadn&#8217;t actually ever been to Eidelyn&#8217;s place of employment before this delivery day. So, when I arrived at what google maps (a.k.a. lying-ass-maps) told me was the correct location, I parked and got out with cupcakes and homemade cards in hand, ready to kiki it up. This is where my day started going a little haywire. So, because Eidelyn is a fancy sort of girl, I had dressed up that day and even worn heels! I know, I know, the real kiki didn&#8217;t wear heels, but I&#8217;m like the grown up version of kiki, who traded in her shoes and broom for heels and a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">unicorn</span> Prius. So, here&#8217;s the funny part. Eidelyn&#8217;s work wasn&#8217;t actually on middlefield road, like the address suggests. So, I walked (in heels, don&#8217;t forget) over these rocky train tracks and through an enormous parking lot in search of her work. Once I finally found it, probably with sweat sticking my baby hairs to my forehead in an oh-so-attractive-and-negating-the-point-of-dressing-nice kind of way, I knocked on the door and was greeted by some very helpful co-workers who informed me that Eidelyn wasn&#8217;t at work that day due to Jury Duty!!!!</p>

<p>Sooooo&#8230;.because I traded in my broom, I was forced to walk all the way back to my car, still carrying birthday treats, and waded through the rocky highlands (train tracks) yet again. Long story short, by the time I finally reached Eidelyn&#8217;s house and banged the door knocker against the house numerous times, I was so exhausted that I had to leave only 11 cupcakes on her porch, because without the sustenance provided by that twelfth cupcake, I may have never made it back to work.</p>

<p>It was all worth it though when she found <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/soundinwater/5889102542">her treats</a> and sent me the best string of emojis that ever existed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first read the &#8220;closed&#8221; sign at Edible Flours after taking a bus for the sole purpose of trying the vegan truffles and stuffed cupcakes, my first reaction was sadness and my second inclination was to vandalize the exterior of their business. How could they be closed after I traveled by plane from California for their cupcakes? It brought back memories of that time that Jocelyn and I walked forever in Portland for vegan soft serve (on this very weekend 2 years ago), only to end in me staring through glass to a desolate let-down. After the disappointment waned, and I hopped on a bus back to gastown, I hopped off the bus to transfer and low and behold, I was in front of a place called death by chocolate! What better way to die???? There isn&#8217;t one&#8230;trust me. I was preparing myself for the disappointment of there being nothing vegan for me, when my spirits were pleasantly lifted! Vegan chocolate cupcakes!!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This vegan bakery is apparently located nearby in the vicinity of the northeast bay area and their <a href="http://foxandfawn.com/home.html" target="_blank">website</a> makes me want to redesign mine asap.

If <a href="http://foxandfawn.com/home.html" target="_blank">this</a> isn&#8217;t inspiration, I don&#8217;t know what can be. Except maybe <a href="http://ipap.me/" target="_blank">this</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/mint-cookies-n-cream-cupcakes/">vegan mint cookies n cream cupcakes</a> are a Robin and Isabelle rendition of the cookies n cream cupcake recipe in Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World (VCTOTW).  For those of you who had the pleasure of visiting Maggie Mudd before they decided to break the hearts of vegans all over the world (well, maybe just in the San Francisco bay area), you may know why the vegan mint cookies n cream ice cream flavor would entice someone to make a cupcake version of it. It&#8217;s basically amazing. And luckily, Colby had a birthday recently, and the exquisite Katie got him the raddest World of Warcraft ice cream cake ever from Maggie Mudd (yes, they haven&#8217;t completely sold us out&#8230;they are still offering ridiculously priced vegan ice cream cakes for you die-hard fans out there)! Instead of going into the details of the cake design being a timeline of all of Colby&#8217;s current and past WOW characters, I will instead describe the deliciousness that is the mint cookies n cream ice cream that was enveloped by a brownie crust and the most delicious whipped topping icing I have ever experienced (I must get more info on this stuff from Violet asap). So, in lieu of ordering a $2749674 cake this evening, Isabelle and I decided to make <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/mint-cookies-n-cream-cupcakes/">these</a> instead.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever thought to yourself, &#8220;I have the best friends in the entire world?&#8221; Well, you would be wrong, because my friends are the best in the whole world, making yours second best. That&#8217;s how ranking works. I know this because I recently started using the rank function in excel for our coffee club at work. I have also learned that if two kinds of coffee have the same ranking (and therefore are tied), then the following ranking skips a number. So, I believe that currently the peaberry from bluebottle and the hair bender from stumptown are in a tie for position 2. That means that the next highest score is ranked 4. Mhm. I&#8217;m basically the ranking expert, so unless you are part of my friend circle, you cannot possible have better friends than the ones I have. And why are my friends so awesome, you ask? Besides the obvious reasons (including their cute factor, their ability-to-put-up-with-me factor, and their fun factor), they also happen to know how to plan the most amazing events! Last weekend is a prime example of this unprecedented skill of theirs. Last weekend, they planned the most amazing of all amazing brunches ever&#8230;.</p>

<p>Vegan Cupcake and Coffee Brunch! You might think that this is not much of a feat, considering there&#8217;s no &#8220;real&#8221; food involved, but considering I am the only vegan in the group, and that this was the first attempt at vegan baking for many of them (first attempt at any baking for one of them), this was basically the best thing ever!</p>

<p>When Amber heard about the cupcake brunch, she suggested there may be too much sweet for one brunch, so Pam and I responded to her concern with pizza cupcakes and spinach and mushroom quiche cupcakes with sun-dried tomato cream cheese icing, in an (inane) effort to have a healthy option.</p>
