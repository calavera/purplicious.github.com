  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every year at Renegade, we notice a particular theme that is popular at that time. We&#8217;ve seen owls, squirrels, and cupcakes. While we were walking the 3758 miles from our parking spot to Fort Mason, we were trying to make guesses on what would win the title of &#8220;most popular theme&#8221; this year. As it turned out, it was a tie. Although Eidelyn was convinced that Godzilla was sure to be the winner, he only appeared at one booth (that I noticed), while the main contestants for the prize were anchors, robots, and narwhales. Was there another one??? I can&#8217;t recall. By the end I could only focus on changing my shoes..haha. However, just when I thought I could focus on nothing other than my ouchy shoes, Zen so politely pointed out these cupcakes, which were the first and only cupcakes I had seen all day (which only served to enforce mine and Eidelyn&#8217;s theory that donuts are the new cupcake). Aren&#8217;t they adorbs? And the only thing cuter is that the maker of these babies goes by the name of <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/goodbyebluemonday?section_id=6627414">goodbyebluemonday</a>!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div>

Quantity: This recipe (VCTOTW) claims to make 24 cupcakes, but it actually makes only 16 if you fill them high enough to make them worth a damn. So, I need to tweak this recipe a bit (darn, more carrot cupcakes in my future). When I get it perfect, I&#8217;ll replace this recipe with a better one.

Cake Ingredients
<ul>
    <li>1½ c flour</li>
    <li>1½ baking soda</li>
    <li>1 t baking powder</li>
    <li>½ t salt</li>
    <li>½ t cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/4 t nutmeg</li>
    <li>1/4 t ginger</li>
    <li>1 1/3 c sugar</li>
    <li>8 oz vanilla wholesoy yogurt</li>
    <li>2/3 c sunflower oil</li>
    <li>1 T vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 c grated carrots (The recipe called for 1 cup, but my mommy always taught me when making carrot cake to double the amount of carrots it calls for because it makes them moister and healthier)</li>
    <li>1 c walnuts</li>
</ul>
Cake Directions

Sift together the first 7 dry ingredients in a large bowl.

In a mixing bowl, mix together sugar, oil, yogurt, and vanilla.

Add the dry ingredients to the wet slowly, and mix.

Add grated carrots and mix until evenly coated. Add walnuts.

Bake in a 350º oven for 24 minutes.

Icing Ingredients
<ul>
    <li>½ c margarine</li>
    <li>½ c tofutti</li>
    <li>2 t vanilla</li>
    <li>4 c powdered sugar</li>
</ul>
Icing Directions

Beat together the margarine, cream cheese, and vanilla extract.

Add the confectioner’s sugar, sifting it in, and then beat until smooth and fluffy.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why have I never thought to make <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/carrot-cupcakes-recipe/">carrot cake cupcakes</a> before? Did I forget how delicious carrot cake was? Is it the lack of chocolatey goodness in them that my aversion, forgetfulness, or avoidance stems from? I don&#8217;t think anyone really knows the answer to these questions, however, I must say that carrot cake cupcakes might just be the new chocolate cupcake for me. I made these for the first time in celebration of Eidelyn&#8217;s birthday. The craft girls all nominated me to be the delivery girl; not because I look like kiki the delivery witch (although I did after my stylist freshly dyed my hair black the weekend before), but because I work in Palo Alto, the closest to Redwood City (workplace of the birthday girl).</p>

<p>Because I have no need to make test tube babies (Who in their right mind would have children on purpose?!), I hadn&#8217;t actually ever been to Eidelyn&#8217;s place of employment before this delivery day. So, when I arrived at what google maps (a.k.a. lying-ass-maps) told me was the correct location, I parked and got out with cupcakes and homemade cards in hand, ready to kiki it up. This is where my day started going a little haywire. So, because Eidelyn is a fancy sort of girl, I had dressed up that day and even worn heels! I know, I know, the real kiki didn&#8217;t wear heels, but I&#8217;m like the grown up version of kiki, who traded in her shoes and broom for heels and a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">unicorn</span> Prius. So, here&#8217;s the funny part. Eidelyn&#8217;s work wasn&#8217;t actually on middlefield road, like the address suggests. So, I walked (in heels, don&#8217;t forget) over these rocky train tracks and through an enormous parking lot in search of her work. Once I finally found it, probably with sweat sticking my baby hairs to my forehead in an oh-so-attractive-and-negating-the-point-of-dressing-nice kind of way, I knocked on the door and was greeted by some very helpful co-workers who informed me that Eidelyn wasn&#8217;t at work that day due to Jury Duty!!!!</p>

<p>Sooooo&#8230;.because I traded in my broom, I was forced to walk all the way back to my car, still carrying birthday treats, and waded through the rocky highlands (train tracks) yet again. Long story short, by the time I finally reached Eidelyn&#8217;s house and banged the door knocker against the house numerous times, I was so exhausted that I had to leave only 11 cupcakes on her porch, because without the sustenance provided by that twelfth cupcake, I may have never made it back to work.</p>

<p>It was all worth it though when she found <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/soundinwater/5889102542">her treats</a> and sent me the best string of emojis that ever existed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first read the &#8220;closed&#8221; sign at Edible Flours after taking a bus for the sole purpose of trying the vegan truffles and stuffed cupcakes, my first reaction was sadness and my second inclination was to vandalize the exterior of their business. How could they be closed after I traveled by plane from California for their cupcakes? It brought back memories of that time that Jocelyn and I walked forever in Portland for vegan soft serve (on this very weekend 2 years ago), only to end in me staring through glass to a desolate let-down. After the disappointment waned, and I hopped on a bus back to gastown, I hopped off the bus to transfer and low and behold, I was in front of a place called death by chocolate! What better way to die???? There isn&#8217;t one&#8230;trust me. I was preparing myself for the disappointment of there being nothing vegan for me, when my spirits were pleasantly lifted! Vegan chocolate cupcakes!!!!</p>
