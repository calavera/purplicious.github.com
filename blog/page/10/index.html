  <div class="entry-content"><p>in addition to having the best mock-meat-lovers pizza I have ever tasted (called the animal lovers pizza-how friggen cute is that?!) and a vegan version of the Samoa girl scout cookie, City O City in Denver, CO also has these amazingly gigantic Ho-Ho cupcakes! These babies are so decadent that even a piggie like me had to share it. If I lived in Denver, I would be a fattie fat fatso and the happiest one you&#8217;d ever meet. Until winter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My beloved friends had a slumber party in my honor last night including all the necessary components of a fabulous slumber party: sangria (duh), mani-pedis, face masks, movies, ordering pizza (thank goodness for Amici&#8217;s-slumber parties across the bay area just got better), and of course, decorating cupcakes. Did I mention eating cupcakes?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We had a friend date where about 10 girls got together and bake a gazillion cupcakes. Some were very experienced cupcake bakers and even had large storage bins full of cute cupcake papers and sprinkles, but they were all new to vegan cupcakes, so I took charge of the situation. The kind neighbors even brought us some homemade sangria to make the cupcake baking go even better. Since we had an Alice in Wonderland theme party to go to that night, Jessica and Jocelyn made cute little eat me tags for the cupcakes so we could bring them with us to the event. I wish I had more pictures of the actual baking (and audio files of the insane dialogue that takes place when you get 10 girls together), but since I don&#8217;t participate in facebook, I don&#8217;t get to steal photos from other people&#8217;s pages. I am on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessicaspacekat/4469215004/" target="_blank">flickr</a>, however.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was pretty confident that I wouldn&#8217;t come across any vegan cupcakes while visiting my mom in BFE, I mean Bonita Springs, Florida. So, I hadn&#8217;t even entertained the prospect of being given a chance to post on my cute little vegan cupcake blog.  However, leave it to me to spot the only cupcake within a 50 mile radius.  I was shopping with my mommy at this place that resembles a grocery outlet called Dixie&#8217;s (read my review of it <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/dixie-liquidation-groceries-bonita-springs#hrid:9HoJRra679FVkg4CPCOsfQ" target="_blank">here</a>), when I spotted the massiveness of its icing:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101" title="Cupcake!!!" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/photo8.jpg" alt="Cupcake!!!" width="540" height="720" /></p>


<p style="text-align: center;">I looked closer only to realize that this cupcake was not only inedible, but likely not made of vegan ingredients.  However, it topped a cupcake stand that beheld vegan wine from a winery in Monterrey called Cupcake winery! How have I not discovered this place before??? Oh yeah, I know why.  Whenever I&#8217;m in Monterrey, it&#8217;s for the sole purpose of looking at cute swimming creatures.  Way more important than wine. However, in the absence of culture and the void of anything cool (in Bonita Springs, FL), this vegan cupcake wine is the best thing I&#8217;ve discovered so far.  The downside: you may need to sit down for this.  The wine is not really made out of cupcakes. I&#8217;m sorry I had to be the one to tell you. It disappointed me as well. If you still want to give it a chance, knowing it has no cupcakes in it, here&#8217;s a closer look at the label:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently Pamela and I attended an <a href="http://ashcanmagazine.com/?p=1330" target="_blank">etsy party in SF</a> where crafters convened in a local bar for our shopping experience.  Everything everyone made was super cute, but of course, the one booth that stood out to me the most was these cute little boxes decorated with beads that looked just like beautiful cupcakes.  The only problem is that they didn&#8217;t taste like cupcakes.  Not that I tasted them.  Because that would be weird.  But if I did, the chances that they were vegan are pretty high.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-96" title="cupcake-boxes" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/cupcake-boxes.jpg" alt="cupcake-boxes" width="420" height="560" /></p>


<p>Sorry the quality was so low, but it was dark in the bar and my camera battery was dead, so I had to use my iPhone.  I also went to the etsy page of the genius who created these beauties, but she has no pictures of them there either.  Sad.  If you want to buy one though, I sure you can use <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/bobbyjane" target="_blank">this etsy page</a> to track her down.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was just going through my inbox and deleting emails that I don&#8217;t have time to read or reply to&#8230;yes, I&#8217;ve become one of those.  If you email me and you want me to read it, you need to make the subject line something very interesting in order to get me to read it.  So, in that vain, I came across an email with the subject line reading, &#8220;Free Panty Cupcake.&#8221; Just the fact that it had the word cupcake caught my eye, then my second thought was some vegan chocolate cupcakes with little fondant panties on top (would this not be the perfect bridal shower or lingerie party snack?).  I opened the email. My excitement dwindled rapidly when I saw the picture of the &#8220;panty cupcake.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91" title="Panty cupcakes" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Screen-shot-2009-11-17-at-7.55.47-PM.png" alt="Panty cupcakes" width="414" height="336" /></p>


<p>Thanks a lot victoria&#8217;s secret.  Only someone disturbed enough to make a bra that increases your breasts by 2 cup sizes would falsely market a panty cupcake by offering you cupcake made out of panties&#8230;.GROSS&#8230;and sick and wrong!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Isabelle is turning 8 and she requested a vampire themed birthday party.  A vampire birthday party for 7-8 year olds consists of this:</p>

<p>1.  A game of munchkin bites (a vampire card game)</p>

<p>2.  A dinner of brains and blood (pasta with marinara), fingers and blood (fries with ketchup), and blood (cherry juice) to drink.</p>

<p>3.  Isabelle requested chocolate cupcakes with gray mint flavored icing and she decorated them with vegan gummies in the shapes of drops of blood and skulls.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/p_1600_1200_6D280864-BFB4-486D-AB3E-6F62B9CBFD74.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-364 aligncenter" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/p_1600_1200_6D280864-BFB4-486D-AB3E-6F62B9CBFD74.jpeg" alt="" width="270" height="360" /></a></p>


<p style="text-align: left;">Your next question (if you&#8217;re like me at least) should be where did these wonderfully vampirific gummies come from?  They have them in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/3696231675/" target="_blank">Sidecar for Pigs Peace</a> vegan store in Seattle, but you can also find them online.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/p_1600_1200_8A737B71-5EDD-4657-9772-FAD1C3CA8BB2.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-364 aligncenter" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/p_1600_1200_8A737B71-5EDD-4657-9772-FAD1C3CA8BB2.jpeg" alt="" width="293" height="390" /></a></p>


<p style="text-align: left;">4.  The remainder of the itinerary included maniacal children running up and down the hallways while they&#8217;re supposed to be sleeping.  There are 3 boys in a room on one end of the hallway and 3 girls in a room on the other end of the hallway. It&#8217;s just too difficult for their coven to be separated apparently.  I think it&#8217;s time for me to go threaten them with garlic.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every year <a href="http://www.empiricaleducation.com/" target="_blank">my work</a> has a halloween party and orders pizza and we have a potluck and a costume contest, etc.  Every year, for the potluck, I bring something main course-ish so I will have something vegan I can eat.  However, this year is the first year we had <a href="http://www.amicis.com/" target="_blank">Amici&#8217;s</a> deliver pizza.  For those of you who may not already know, Amici&#8217;s has a vegan pizza on their menu called the asante and it has daiya cheese on it which is the best vegan cheese I&#8217;ve seen/tasted yet. So, since we ordered vegan pizza, I was able to make halloween cupcakes due to popular demand from my co-workers. Orange and black!</p>
