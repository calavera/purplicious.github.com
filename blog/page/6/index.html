  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chris and Evelyn love us so much that they sent us 2 boxes of chick-o-sticks! This is basically a lifetime supply of chick-o-sticks for an average family of bears, but luckily, I am a very creative bear. This is where the invention of butterfinger cupcakes came from. The world will have Chris and Evelyn to thank for <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/butterfinger-cupcakes-recipe/">this recipe</a>.</p>

<p>I took some pictures of the process since it&#8217;s a newly invented recipe. I am normally a proponent of filling cupcake papers almost all the way so as to maximize the amount of cucpake, but in this recipe, it&#8217;s best to not overfill or the chick-o-sticks in the batter will make the cucpakes stick to the pan.</p>

<p>Isabelle was in charge of mashing the chick-o-sticks. For the ones that went into the batter, she put them into a ziplock freezer bag and used to a rolling pin to beat them like a battered spouse. My plan was to use the rolling pin to roll them into small pieces, but apparently, chick-o-sticks are harder than I thought so the rolling pin basically posed as a hammer. When it was time to make the icing, I brought up the idea of using the mortar and pestle to pulverize the sticks into a fine dust. That was a much quieter method. I suggest that one for the future. I also considered a food processor, but never made it that far. Maybe next time&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The button on the scarf is supposed to be the cherry on the cupcake. By the way, why is it that every time we draw a cupcake, we make a cherry on top? When you examine the ratio of non-edible cupcakes with cherries to edible ones with cherries, I figure it would be something like 379562:1. Really, when is the last time you ate a cupcake with a cherry on it? I&#8217;m pretty sure I can honestly answer never.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While traveling recently, I came to an epiphany that earplugs, while safe, useful, and important, are the ugliest things in the world (except for anteaters: I wanted to get one of those to help out with my ant problem in my kitchen, but they&#8217;re just so ugly that I think I would be embarrassed to have company over). So, except for anteaters, earplugs are very likely the ugliest things ever. And unlike facial masks or hair curlers, we typically wear earplugs in public places where people could potentially be judging us. So, I decided to create an earplug mask if you will. Something that hides the ugliness of earplugs, without sacrificing the usability. Tadaaaaaaaaa.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight is <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2011/01/10/sf-vegan-bakesale-this-saturday/">bakesale</a> preparation night! I realize the bake sale isn&#8217;t until Saturday, but you really shouldn&#8217;t put things off until the last minute. Okay, I admit, I always put things off until the last minute. The real reason I am all of a sudden not a procrastinator tonight is because the cupcakes are being delivered through a chain of multiple people tomorrow to find their way to the bakesale safely (I hope!)</p>

<p>So, the <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/voodoo-ronalds-donut-cupcakes-recipe/">recipe</a> for the bakesale cupcakes is the same one I used last weekend for <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2011/01/08/fun-a-day-8/">Gabe&#8217;s birthday cupcakes</a>. The only difference being that the bakesale cupcake won&#8217;t be covered in fondant versions of super mario brothers details. The bakesale is trying to appeal to a wider audience, not just nerdy-videogame-loving-30ish-adults-that-act-like-children (although if the majority of the bakesale attendees fall into that category, then yay!)</p>

<p>I hope the doggies and the birdies get lots of money from these cupcakes because they are a pain in the tail feathers to make let me tell you. Since I already posted the recipe last weekend, all you get today is more photos of the process of assembling these bad boys.</p>

<p>Oh, and the superb Vi Zahajszky, author of KQED&#8217;s food blog, Bay Area Bites, wrote <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/bayareabites/2011/01/14/sf-vegan-bakesale-eat-cake-save-animals/" target="_blank">this lovely article</a> about the bakesale.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Emily&#8217;s first question when she walks in the door, &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t we making cupcakes?&#8221; Little miss self-proclaimed most non-domestic friend I have wanted to know why we weren&#8217;t putting on our aprons and playing Betty Crocker this evening. Go figure. My response? Because we&#8217;re making gift card holders. As I explained to Emily, I have a bundle of gift cards in my purse that are being held in place by a rubber band. I wish I could say that I am so popular around the holidays that I received all of these as gifts, but sadly, I had to buy them for myself. Why would anyone buy gift cards for themselves, unless it was some crazy deal like the one Bloomspot is having right now? I bought not only to make myself feel loved, but also to support Zen and Isabelle&#8217;s school fundraiser.* I feel extremely ghetto when using any of my gift cards and sometimes notice myself trying to get my gift card out of my purse without anyone in public noticing this rubber band method because honestly, it&#8217;s rather embarrassing, non-cute, and doesn&#8217;t make my heart go pitter-patter. There seems no point in having things that do not fall into that latter category, so lo and behold, all gift cards now have a real (and cute) home. Let&#8217;s hope it&#8217;s a permanent adoption and this home can hold up to the abuse my purse can dole out because otherwise my foster children will be looking for another home at some point in the future. Nobody wants to be a foster child.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sunday should be a lazy day, but instead, I woke up before 9am and started organizing fabric and deciding what to make for cupcake-a-day #9. The fabric I was color coding was from an organization called &#8220;FabMo&#8221; that rescues fabric samples from the landfill. They request that you use it in a way that gives back to the community and they request a donation to be able to keep running, but other than those rules, it&#8217;s basically free fabric. So, I went for my first time yesterday (after a year and a half of meaning to check it out) and got a few bags of small pieces of fabric. So, my plan is this: since Jessica and I now have a new etsy store called ShojoPop, I decided to convert my Purplicious store into a non-profit-esque one, in which all profits from all sales are donated to some animal rescuing organization. I haven&#8217;t worked out many of the details yet, but I started off my morning organizing the fabric I got and making 3 market bags. I only made one cupcake themed, but if it sells, then I&#8217;ll likely make more&#8230;who wouldn&#8217;t want a market bag with a cupcake applique on it? Nobody could resist that right? Well, maybe they could, but they might just buy it anyway&#8230;to help animals. I&#8217;ll try this for a year and see how it goes. I brought it up to the craft group last night at Gabe&#8217;s birthday party and everyone is willing to devote one night each month to making things for the animals. Yay for awesome friends!!!!</p>

<p>The cupcake tote was made with soft purple chenille ottoman(70% cotton; 30% rayon). The color is called Mulberry and the fabric was made by <a href="http://kravet.com/fabrics/couture.htm" target="_blank">Kravet Couture</a> in New York, USA.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Helllooooooo weekend! So, so very nice to see you. Today I have been engulfed in cupcake land for about 3 hours, and it looks to be about 3 more to go. In addition to being cupcake-a-day #8, it is also the day of Gabe&#8217;s birthday party. Gabe (well, actually Virginia and Jocelyn) decided on a game themed birthday, which as I understand it, means we will being playing a plethora of board and video games this evening. So, when Virginia and Jocelyn decided on this theme, they emailed the most hilarious PDF of &#8220;how to throw a successful game night.&#8221; This seriously made me laugh so hard when I saw it because it looked like it was scanned from a 1970&#8217;s version of good housekeeping or some shit. The beginning of the story talked about how it&#8217;s good to have a color theme for your party, so after inquiring as to what color plate I should be bringing my game-themed snacks on, I discovered that the color theme for the party is blue. So, today I had to run out to the store to get blue cupcake papers because I only had black, pink, purple, red, and white. Now I have blue and green too because Michaels sells their cupcake papers in 2-color sets. I highly recommend getting yours there because 1) they have polka dots on them and everything with polka dots is cute, and 2) they almost always have a 40% off coupon online, so you end up getting 75 cupcake papers for only $1.39.</p>

<p>Soooo&#8230;.I, for some insane reason, decided to make a <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/voodoo-ronalds-donut-cupcakes-recipe/">cupcake recipe</a> that has 3 parts: the cake, the filling, and the icing. So far, I have made parts 1 &amp; 2. Then in addition to the icing, Jessica and I are going to [attempt to] decorate them with fondant. We are thinking a tetris theme, but we may incorporate some other video/board games into the mix. So, the recipe I&#8217;m working on is an altered version of the Vegan Cupcakes Take Over The World recipe called Boston Creme Pie. However, I&#8217;m trying to make mine taste less like pie and more like the custard filled donuts that you get at Ronalds and/or Voodoo Donut shops. I love a creme filled donut. And since I can&#8217;t always go to Portland or Vegas, I&#8217;m hoping to create a treat than can satisfy the craving.</p>

<p>&#8230;::time elapse::.. So, I made the mistake of taking a nap, and therefore had little time for artistic creativity. Our grandeur plans of making mini fondant dominoes kind of went out the window and we settled a one common theme of our all-time favorite childhood video game, Super Mario Brothers. We got our inspiration from this artistic genius named <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hello_naomi/2207881678" target="_blank">hello naomi</a>.</p>
