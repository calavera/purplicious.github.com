  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bradley is coming into town, and it became a tradition to regale him with cupcakes since the last time he came to Sacramento with the Deftones.</p>

<p>I asked him what flavor he wanted, and he simply stated that he wants my specialty - which is, of course, chocolate.</p>

<p>I chose a vanilla fairy icing, because most people are allergic to fairy icing (the most common symptom is that your ears become pointy). But Bradley has an immunity to all high-allergen foods, so he will be just fine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, for some reason, unbeknownst to me, the girls at my work enjoy any and all conversations and activities having to do with things I do not like to disclose about myself. These include age, childhood stories, and embarassing moments. Therefore, it should not have come as any surprise when the party planning committee (PPC) at work chose the theme for the October birthday celebration of &#8220;bring the most awkward photos from your middle school days to work for everyone to not only, point, laugh, and ridicule, but also vote. As you can imagine, winning the most votes in this competition was not at all like winning something cool, like a cupcake baking competition or a marathon. It was closer to a reverse beauty pageant (aka. Ugly duckling contest).</p>

<p>What flavor cupcake goes best with humility? Yep, you guessed it! Peanut Butter Cupcakes with Chocolate Ganache.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Red Velvet Cafe rocks my world! And when I say &#8220;rocks my world&#8221; what I really mean is that it&#8217;s a darned good thing that Vegas is a state away or I would be there so much that they might consider getting a restraining order.</p>

<p>Until recently, I have never had the experience of enjoying any desserts at Red Velvet Cafe because Vegas, being the home of Ronald&#8217;s donuts, always inflicts this duty in me to eat my weight in donuts, leaving no room in my dessert stomach (yes, <em>it is</em> a different stomach&#8230;duh) for anything else. However, it just so happened that on this particular day, our flight landed right about the time that Ronald&#8217;s was closing for the day and wouldn&#8217;t reopen until 4am the next morning. So&#8230;I purposely only ate half of my tuna melt so that I could save room for dessert, and that could very well have been the best decision of my life&#8230;or at least the day.</p>

<p>This cupcake was not only the perfect amount of moistness with the perfect flavored icing, but it was HUGE, as every cupcake should be. Some of the woosie-assed cupcakes I see around here make me feel a pig (more than usual) because I have to eat 2 (or 4) of them to be satisfied. Here&#8217;s a hint to all vegan bakers of the world. Ignore the part of the recipe that says to fill the cups 2/3 of the way. Fill them up! We love it when they puff up over the top and look like muffins when they come out of the oven! LOVE! That&#8217;s the way cupcakes should be.</p>

<p>So, finally, what we&#8217;ve all been waiting for: the drool material.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I made these to bring to my friend Sam in LA this weekend. I texted him, &#8220;chocolate or lemon&#8221; with no other reference or information and he texted back lemon. So, I decided to try the strawberry lemonade cupcakes that won the RPS bake-off two years ago. Luckily, my friend Emily came over last night so I put her to work molding tiny lemons out of marzipan. She claims to not be domestic but apparently people will do anything for a cupcake. haha.</p>

<p>Next weekend in the mission&#8230;vegan cupcake sale (and I guess for some reason they choose to allow other baked goods to enter the premises) that all proceeds go to awesome causes. What more could you ask for? That yours truly will be providing some cute and decadent cupcakes that you will not only want to sink your teeth into, but also possible rub all over your body (and the bodies of cute life partners)? Well, then, you&#8217;re in luck! But I won&#8217;t tell you what I&#8217;ll be making because it&#8217;s a surprise&#8230;or maybe because I haven&#8217;t decided yet&#8230;and if it&#8217;s the latter, I may be open to suggestion, so feel free to try to persuade me to make your favorite recipe.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, this apron has vegan cupcakes on it and no, you may not eat them. You can lick them if you can find this apron, but it will be hard to find as it is about to travel from california to florida to philly to new jersey. You might have to settle for licking your computer monitor. Oh don&#8217;t act like you&#8217;ve never done that before&#8230;pervert!</p>

<p>I created this apron for my good friend Melissa because she just started a vegan food truck in New Jersey and therefore needs an apron (clearly). I loved the blue and pink cupcake fabric, and when I realized that I would be lining it anyway, blue bear suggested that I make it reversible! Genius! I love reversible clothes and although I have none, I always think about them and covet them. This apron came out so cute that I kinda want to keep it. But Melissa should have it I guess. Well, maybe we&#8217;ll see if she has good behavior before we decide. haha. Before you say, why is it all poochy at the top, please understand that the mannequinn has size A boobs, whereas Melissa (I don&#8217;t know this for a fact because I don&#8217;t have a special skill to just look at boobs and know what size they are) has size D boobs. When discussing this with blue bear during the creation of the apron, he requested that I not use the word boobs when we have company. So many rules&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, Pamela missed her friends birthday and felt super bad so we knew we couldn&#8217;t make just any old cupcake recipe to make up for that. We decided on the cookies n cream cupcakes from Vegan Cupcakes Take Over The World because who doesn&#8217;t love Newman O&#8217;s, Chocolate cupcakes with cookies inside them, and big dollops of icing mixed with cookie crumbs. If you don&#8217;t already have the book, what are you doing even reading this. Command T and go to half.com and buy the book IMMEDIATELY!  Here&#8217;s some pictures from that day.</p>
