  <div class="entry-content"><p>The idea of making cupcake napkins was a combination of jocelyn telling me that it would be cute to display the napkin rings on cupcake napkins and our recent visit to crown and crumpet. I haven&#8217;t uploaded the 253 pictures of cute cupcake things that I spotted while at crown &amp; crumpet yet, but one of them was cupcake napkins. So&#8230;cupcake-a-day #24 was dedicated to 4 pink cupcake napkins.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cupcake postcards are sooooooooooooooo cute! I kind of wish I had made a cupcake postcard for each day of the month, except that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have enough friends to send them all to. Pam would wonder why I wrote her 31 postcards. haha. This one is valentine&#8217;s themed because I figure by the time the <a href="http://artclash.com/" target="_blank">art show</a> is over, it will be just in time for me to mail it to someone for valentine&#8217;s day.</p>

I got distracted. Oh, yeah. So, I don&#8217;t like having things sitting around collecting dust. So, the cupcake I made yesterday needed to be turned into something extraordinary. Isabelle had the idea of a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessicaspacekat/5381147721" target="_blank">cupcake flip watch</a> and I didn&#8217;t realize how difficult the engineering would be on this.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>cupcake-a-day #20 has an element of secrecy. it&#8217;s kind of one of those for me to know and you to find out things. as soon as there is no danger of being discovered, I will post photos, accompanied by an explanation.</p>

<p>So&#8230;here we are a few days after the secret post. I&#8217;m sure nobody has been losing sleep over this, but it&#8217;s time to reveal the big secret. So, for a few months, we were planning a surprise half-birthday party* for Jessica and my cupcake project for Thursday night was to make cupcake coasters as party favors for the party. In fear of her reading the blog and me spoiling part or all of the surprise, I had to leave my post unfinished. The coasters we Pamela&#8217;s idea since we were having a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/5383749934/" target="_blank">tea party for Jessica</a>, it made perfect sense to have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jocelyntran/5381582036" target="_blank">the coasters</a> as the souvenir.</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-547" href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2011/01/20/fun-a-day-20/coasters2/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-547" title="coasters2" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/coasters2-e1295848377731-343x510.jpg" alt="" width="343" height="510" /></a></p>

<p>*Doesn&#8217;t everyone celebrate their half-birthday? Well, if they don&#8217;t then they are missing out! Who wouldn&#8217;t want another holiday to have as an excuse to get all your friends together all dressed up?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was the perfect day for ShojoPop night for a multitude of reasons. The first reason being that I got my new camera in the mail today! And not only that, but after many failed attempts at trying to figure out how to use my new eye-fi card with my new camera, I really needed to make something ultra-cute and candy/cupcake-esque to make myself feel better about my ineptness with technology. I think this camera case proves to the world that you don&#8217;t have to be good with technology as long as you can make cute cases for your technological items. And can I just reiterate how much I love love love things that are reversible?! Now I have a camera case that matches <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2010/07/12/cupcake-apron/">Melissa&#8217;s apron</a>! Not only is the case itself reversible, but the pink ribbon has beads that are reversed from the order of the blue ribbon. Oh, how I love the asymmetry!</p>

<p>Thank you Eidelyn for taking the cutest pictures ever even though it&#8217;s almost midnight on a school night!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve never owned napkin rings before because a) I rarely need a napkin because I eat so fast that by the time I realize I need one, I&#8217;m done and I just wash my hands and b) similar to reason a, I don&#8217;t do a lot of sitting at the table with my napkin in a ring because the second my butt hits the chair, I&#8217;m shoveling food into my mouth. In fact, sometimes (you can ask the people I work with for proof), I start shoveling it in before I even get to my seat while walking. That&#8217;s what a piggie I am. However, the fact that napkin rings are unnecessary hasn&#8217;t kept me from admiring other (non-piggie) people&#8217;s napkin rings and wondering if I would ever grow up and have some of my very own. I got tired of waiting for that to happen, so I just decided to make some. I may never use them. I may give them away. I may list them on <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/ShojoPop" target="_blank">etsy</a>. But at least now I can say, that I pretended to be a sophisticated-napkin-ring-owning individual for at least a week. These photos are a sad reality of how bad I am at sculpting. This is the reason that I put Jessica in charge of fondant tasks. The funniest (and when I say funniest, I really mean most symbolic of my inept sculpting ability, aka lack thereof) part of this cupcake-a-day #18 project is that unlike 99.85% of the population who improve with practice, my best napkin ring of the night was the first one I did. It actually looks like a cupcake. The second through fourth look like weird midget ice cream cones. Can you guess which one I made first?* Apparently I undergo the reverse of practice makes perfect. Which would be perfect makes practice? Ummm&#8230;I think it&#8217;s past my bedtime.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today is Chris&#8217; birthday and luckily he has a Lori in his life that makes him vegan cupcakes on his birthday. Today she used <a href="http://loveveg.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/vanilla-cupcakes/" target="_blank">this recipe</a> and stuck a marshmallow in the batter before baking and it turned out like a volcano. She didn&#8217;t use icing (which is admittedly not very cupcake-like), but the icing would have hidden the unique volcano quality. Yay for birthdays that involve vegan cupcakes!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m usually pretty amazed at the amount of good ideas I can manage to come up with when intoxicated. Either they&#8217;re good ideas or I just think they&#8217;re really good due to my altered state. Regardless, cupcake-a-day #17 is the result of an epiphany I had at Pamela&#8217;s cocktail party on New Year&#8217;s Eve. Being the classy bunch that we are, we were sipping our fancy cocktails out of red plastic solo cups. The upside to red solo cups is that they hold a lot, which is always important for every new year&#8217;s eve. The downside is that after drinking the contents of one of these, you start to set your cup down and then forget which of the numerous red cups is yours. So, at the time, my first brilliant plan was for each person to write their name on their cups. So, Emily found us a black pen and we all wrote our names on our cups. However, when you have an icy beverage, the condensation on the outside of the cup turns any markings that once resembled a name into black smudges all over everyone&#8217;s hands. So, at this point, we are not only returned to our original issue, but we now all have dirty hands..haha. Luckily we were on drink 2 or 5 at this point and so it didn&#8217;t really matter. But that&#8217;s when I came up with my brilliant solution. Solo cup cozies! I decided that for Pam&#8217;s next birthday, she&#8217;s getting a set of solo cup cozies so that at our next cocktail soiree, each guest will have their own personalized cup. Tonight I made the first one in the set which is (surprise!) cupcake themed. This was also my first journey into the realm of installing snaps. I only wasted about half the package, but I&#8217;m basically a professional now. You can tell by the asymmetry. Only professionals can do that. It&#8217;s true. Look it up. But look at these pretty pictures first and hopefully their beauty will help you forget what you were gonna look up.</p>
