  <div class="entry-content"><p>Melissa finally opened her very own vegan cafe! She just missed the mark a tad by opening it on the wrong side of the country, but I&#8217;m hoping that it will get so popular that she will have to expand and open a branch here. Then I can quit my job and become a cupcake artist full-time at her bay area branch with her while she has Andrea run her South Jersey branch.</p>

<p>If you live in or near South Jersey or have friends/relatives who do, make sure everyone knows about this place because the only thing Melissa does better than cook is make babies (I am by no means implying that baby making is on the menu; it was just a comparison. Although, if the price is right, then email me and we might be able to work something out. shhh&#8230;)</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s her <a href="http://www.thedailyjournal.com/article/20110218/NEWS01/102180308/Vegan-eatery-opens-Millville">feature in the paper</a>, her <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/wildflower-earthly-vegan-fare-millville">yelp</a>, and the <a href="http://wildflowervegan.com/">link to the menu</a> (I know her website needs help and if I were a good friend, I would assist in that department, but instead I opted to make her the cute apron that she&#8217;s wearing in the photo.) If you happen to glance <a href="http://wildflowervegan.com/archive/Wildflower%20Bi-Fold%202-20.pdf">this week&#8217;s menu</a>, they have (I&#8217;ll try not to scream this) butternut cupcakes!!!! I&#8217;m getting hungry just thinking about them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are so cute that it&#8217;s almost worth the effort of making them. If I had a dish washer or a dish slave, then I think it would even out, but as of now, I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ll be making these again. You basically have to bake twice because you bake the hearts first. Virginia always sends me the cutest cupcake ideas and <a href="http://bakeitinacake.com/recipes/heartinacupcake">this</a> was one that she sent me. So, I of course had to make a vegan version, which was basically just the vanilla cupcake recipe from VCTOTW. Although, if I make them again, I will make more batter because these cupcakes came out kind of tiny. Which in this instance was fine because they were for tiny people. You also may be wondering why I opted for brown hearts instead of pink. GOOD question! I wanted pink hearts, but 2 of Isabelle&#8217;s classmates have allergies to red food coloring, so I thought I would be sly and get the all natural food coloring from whole foods (which costs around $20), but to my disappointment, the &#8220;red&#8221; is actually brown. <em>sigh</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Technically, Fun-a-day month is over, but since I started this project and almost completed it before February, I&#8217;m going to count it. I&#8217;ve been wanting a cupcake shaped purse for a long time. This one looked a bit cuter in my imagination than real life (like most things) but I think it&#8217;s a good start. Maybe I&#8217;ll make it differently next time. I just realized I didn&#8217;t take any pictures of the inside, with the cupcake lining, but I am so sleepy and still have so much to do to prepare for the art show so this will have to do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, during my working meeting with Jessica and Josipa (and the Philz barista) today, we discussed making business cards to bring to the art opening that&#8217;s on Friday night at <a href="http://calendar.rpscollective.com/view_entry.php?id=1747&amp;date=20110205" target="_blank">Oakland Art Murmur</a>. It only made sense to use this as one of my cupcake-a-day projects and since I didn&#8217;t have much time today, thanks to waking up after noon (I&#8217;m not lazy, we just didn&#8217;t go to bed until 7am) and our poor welcoming of a Sunday afternoon by turning it into a workday, I figured today would be the perfect day to make a business card for the ieatcupcakes.com website, as well as the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/ShojoPop" target="_blank">ShojoPop etsy store</a>. Many of the items made for this project are going to be sold on ShojoPop, but since they will all be on display for most of the month of February, they won&#8217;t be sold until March. But I figured this way, if anyone sees something they must own, they can take a business card and find it later on etsy. So, here is the business card I just whipped up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pamela has a life full of everything cute, which not only gives you a warm fuzzy feeling whenever you enter her domain, but it&#8217;s also a good opportunity to cute-ify yourself when in her presence. I used these nail polish pens to (badly) draw cupcakes on my toenails. Whenever I complain of my ineptness at drawing, Zen usually tries to console me by mentioning that I can draw cupcakes. Sometimes, he&#8217;s right. In this situation, he clearly is not. I would like to provide a warning at this time, for those who have weak stomachs or just have an aversion to feet in general, you are about to see photos of feet. I apologize in advance if you already saw the photos before receiving the warning. The strangest part of this is how my cupcake looks more realistic after a few hours of wearing shoes and socks. Art is so mysterious. haha.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cupcake-a-day #27 was the Saturday morning themed birthday party at work. I sent the email out yesterday letting everyone know that there would be breakfast served for lunch and that we could all wear our jammies to work. So, you can imagine my surprise when I arrived at work today to find that I was the only person wearing pajamas. Apparently, everyone thought I was just kidding. I mean I do have a very witty sense of humor, but it&#8217;s not that good. I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that I park about a block away from work and that one block walk got me more stares than I ever thought possible. Apparently, Palo Alto doesn&#8217;t see many people wearing footie pajamas in public. Anyway, included in breakfast today were the coffee cake cupcakes that Jessica and I made last night and I ate, not 1, not 2, but 3! Oink oink. I&#8217;m also excited to say that when I left for the day, there were still some left and I plan to eat more tomorrow. Woohoo!</p>

<p>The cupcake craft for today is a shower cap! I love shower caps! I only wash my hair every 10 days or so (unless that&#8217;s weird, in which case I wash it every other day), so I am a firm believer in using shower caps on the non-hair-washing days. Guess what fabric today&#8217;s shower cap is made out of?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of months ago, Jessica discovered a cookbook written by a bed and breakfast in Kentucky at her mom&#8217;s house and decided it would be great to make this scrumptious looking coffee cake recipe from the book. I agreed that coffee cake sounded good. I like coffee. I like cake. How can it be bad?</p>

<p>Then, at work, I found out that the birthday party theme for January/February birthdays is breakfast. So, being the one that usually bakes the birthday cupcakes, I was trying to think of what kind of cake would be acceptable as a breakfast item, when I remembered Jessica&#8217;s b&amp;b coffee cake!</p>

<p>So, tonight we decided to turn ShojoPop night into backwoods country cooking night and not only veganized the coffee cake recipe, but also turned it into coffee cake cupcakes. We learned a few things from this process, including the following.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Do not spread the blueberry layer all the way to the edges or it compromises the structural integrity of the cupcake.</p></li>
<li><p> Do not ever open a bed and breakfast because the amount of work involved in making coffee cake is totally not worth the effort.</p></li>
<li><p> Coffee cake is supposed to have cinnamon. I guess people in Kentucky don&#8217;t use cinnamon in their coffee cake, but here in California, we think coffee cake without cinnamon is just, just, just weird.</p></li>
<li><p> Jessica looks unbelievably adorable in a le petite apron and chef hat.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Here are some pictures of the process. I will try to post the recipe within the next couple of days.</p>
