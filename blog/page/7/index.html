  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m soooo tired. After my 3 hour nap last night and then working all day, this wine glass charm was all I could muster up the energy for. While I was in the shower, I was pondering why this had to be the cupcake-a-day project that I am least happy with. Once upon a time, I was really good at shrinky dinks. I might even admit to being an expert at them.  Now, I seriously suck! This wine charm is kinda warped. Certainly not the flat, thick plastic that I remember shrinky dinks being. I&#8217;m going to sleep now and I hope that I don&#8217;t have dreams about the cute wine charms in my cupboard making fun of the new subpar one. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll make my cupcake extra cute to make up for this one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Welcome to cupcake-a-day #5. I have not yet failed, but tomorrow will be the ultimate test because I&#8217;ll be attending the <a href="http://www.mocfa.org/craftbar/index.htm" target="_blank">etsy craft lab</a> in hopes of finding something I can make that will somehow be related to cupcakes. It might take a bit of imagination on your part, but if I can think up 31 cupcake-related activities this month, the least you can do is get off your ass and use a little imagination. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m asking you to make anything. Pshh. But that&#8217;s tomorrow. To quote Zen, let&#8217;s focus on the present, shall we. And the present is that I spent about four hours (ok, ok, some of that four hours may have been spent eating cupcakes, booking emerald con flights to Seattle, and looking through my wardrobe) making cupcake shoe bows this evening. In my mind, I&#8217;m envisioning these shoe bows on my china flats (aka Kung Fu shoes, according to Douglas), but when discussing my emerald con packing list, I will only be bringing boots so as to minimize complaints of frozen toes. How can I put shoe bows on boots???!!! ::sigh::</p>

<p>I would like to thank Eidelyn for being my photographer this evening (with her slew of fancy camera apps on her phone), as I was busy earning a spot in vegan hell by slaying an extended family of ants in my kitchen. That&#8217;s what happens in this house if you try to eat one of my cupcakes without asking.* Anyone else want to challenge me? I didn&#8217;t think so. It was the last cupcake too. ::visualize my sad face here with the bottom lip protruding::  How about some pictures of shoe bows to cheer us up?</p>

<p>*Exception: Dexter ate a cupcake off the arm of the couch once (paper and all-such a barbarian), and he is still alive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Happy January 4! I had to make something easy tonight since I went to my work&#8217;s annual holiday/new year party.</p>

<p>Me: Bye. Thanks for having me.</p>

<p>Them: Why are you leaving so soon?</p>

<p>Me: I have a cupcake pincushion to make.</p>

<p>The conversation didn&#8217;t really go that way, but I did have a discussion with Alissa and her partner, Sonny, and they both brought the possibility that by January 31 (or sooner), I may grow to hate cupcake. ::gasp:: Is that a possibility? Does anyone in the entire world hate cupcakes? I just did a google search and there is apparently a facebook group for people who hate cupcakes and it actually has 148 members! In fact, in October 2010, Pierre Antoine said, &#8220;cupcakes are retard.&#8221; Yeah, Antoine. Cupcakes aren&#8217;t the only ones riding the short bus buddy. Anywho&#8230;there&#8217;s a possibility that I already own a pincushion (ok, fine I have 2), but does anyone really like the tomato pincushion. It&#8217;s kind of too hard to easily put your pins in one-handed, and I&#8217;ve never been one to enjoy having the same something as everyone else. Let&#8217;s face it, the tomato pincushion is thumbs down. So, what kind of pincushion is thumbs up? I thought you&#8217;d never ask.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tic - Tac - Toe! This was Zen&#8217;s idea, and who doesn&#8217;t love to play a game of tic-tac-toe, especially when you don&#8217;t have to waste paper (I mean if you&#8217;re not using a reusable tic-tac-toe board, you might as well be driving a hummer). It was supposed to be chocolate cupcakes versus vanilla cupcakes, but the first game I played with Douglas, I was white cupcakes and he was black, but I won. And we all know in real life, vanilla would never win over chocolate, so this game is clearly make-believe. But isn&#8217;t make-believe cute?!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Happy 2nd day in the new year! Otherwise known in these parts as the second cupcake-a-day! So, because I was forced to leave my vehicle parked in SF Friday night/yesterday morning due to my blood alcohol content being 375.6, I had to try to think of a way to get my car back. Luckily, I have a Kylene in my life. If you don&#8217;t have one, I highly suggest acquiring one immediately. A Kylene is a cute friend who is not only fun and brings you cute vegan presents (even though she&#8217;s not vegan herself), but pretty much never says no to any favor you ask of her. She&#8217;s amazing and life would be paltry without her. So, cupcake-a-day today was dedicated to making Kylene a thank-you-for-being-the-awesomest-friend-in-the-world-and-driving-my-car-40-miles-to-bring-it-back-to-me present. This present consists of the flavor of cupcake that is apparently Kylene&#8217;s self-claimed favorite of all the cupcakes I have ever baked for her experienced cupcake palette to sample. She&#8217;s not the only one who likes them. They won third place in the <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2009/09/29/cupcake-themed-party/">RPS cupcake contest</a> last year too. I call them ET&#8217;s favorite cupcakes, because to me, they taste like reeses pieces.*  They are chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter filling and peanut butter icing, and even thought Kylene generally is not a fan of peanut butter (even with chocolate! weird right?), she seems to love these. My recipe is similar to the one in Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World, but if you don&#8217;t have that book or you want to try my version, you can check out the recipe <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/e-t-cupcake-recipe/">here</a>.</p>

<p>*In all fairness, I could be miles from accurate with my assessment of what they taste like, because I haven&#8217;t had reeses pieces in over a decade. BTW, anyone who finds me the vegan version of reeses pieces is not only going to be responsible for future cavities and a 10 pound weight gain, but is also my new god(dess), and I will name my next cupcake recipe after you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So&#8230;now that we only have a few minutes left in the day, I am happy to announce that I have completed day one of cupcake-a-day! It wasn&#8217;t easy due to my many injuries I managed to acquire last night in my state-of-bringing-in-the-new-year. So, I hobbled around the house and managed with my blistered feet, slashed shoulder, and gouged knuckle to produce not one, but two felt cupcake luggage tags. Just what you&#8217;ve always wanted right? Can you just imagine how easy it will be to tell your costco black suitcase from everyone else&#8217;s when it rolls out on the belt wearing a stylish cupcake? Mhm.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So&#8230;what January actually is is <a href="http://www.artclash.com/" target="_blank">fun-a-day</a> month. If you haven&#8217;t heard of this, it&#8217;s basically where you take your already too-busy life and add deadline-intensive activities to each day of an entire month. Sounds fun right? No? Well, I probably just didn&#8217;t describe it in the right light. What fun-a day means to each person is different, but for me, it means that each and every day in January, I will participate in some cupcake-related activity and I will document it daily here. So, for those of you who are used to me only posting once every other month, watchout! Prepare to be inundated with photos, ravings, and complaints about this &#8220;art&#8221; project. If you would like to subject yourself to this punishment-a-day, please read more <a href="http://www.artclash.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and signup. And then give me moral support that I&#8217;m not in this alone. So&#8230;tomorrow is my last day of freedom-from-cupcake-activities. My goal for tomorrow is to not drink so much that I fail at this art project on day 1. I want to at least make it to day 3 before failure sets in.</p>
